C++ (Cpp) Adventure Game

**Version 1.0.0**

A readme for the Adventure Game

---

This program was written in Dev Bloodshed Cpp and runs as a cpp.exe.

The game contains a word based GUI that requires the use of:

n- north 
s- south
e- east
w- west

in order to move about within the dungeon setting- with some limitations depending on 
where in the dungeon you are currently (ex: theres a fork in the road...there are only
2 directions you can go)If you can't go in a certain direction, the previous line will be
repeated- allowing you to try again.

Within the dungeon you are confronted by the Riddle Monkeys that require the correct answer
input for you to move on. Guess incorrectly and you lose. These answers are not case sensitive.

Due to this being an early model of the game, you may experience the game crashing. I, or anybody 
willing to contribute to the project will try and put out a new version soon. 

Hope you enjoy!
